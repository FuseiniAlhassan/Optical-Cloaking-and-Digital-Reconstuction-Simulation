# Optical-Cloaking-and-Digital-Reconstuction-Simulation
# Abstract
This project presents a computational framework for simulating phase-based optical cloaking and exploring digital reconstruction techniques in wave optics. The simulation models a cloaking device as an annular phase-shifting region embedded in a 2D wave field, designed to obscure a square object by manipulating the phase of incident light. By applying a spatially varying phase mask derived from refractive index modulation, the object becomes visually undetectable in the resulting intensity distribution.To counteract the cloaking effect, the system implements both direct and iterative reconstruction algorithms that attempt to recover the original object from the altered wavefront. The iterative method enforces physical constraints such as positivity and spatial support, refining the reconstruction through successive approximations. An interactive interface allows users to dynamically improve the reconstruction and visualize error metrics in real time. This simulation bridges theoretical optics and computational imaging, offering insights into inverse problems, phase retrieval, and wavefront engineering. It demonstrates the feasibility of digitally reversing optical cloaking effects and provides a platform for exploring advanced concepts in holography, metamaterials, and optical signal processing. The project reflects a strong foundation in numerical modeling, algorithmic design, and scientific visualizationâ€”skills essential for graduate-level research in applied physics and photonics.
# ðŸ§± Key Components
1. Object and Cloak Generation
â€¢ 	: Generates a square object in a 2D grid.
â€¢ 	: Creates an annular mask representing the cloaking region.
2. Phase Shift Modeling
â€¢ 	: Computes the phase shift induced by the cloak based on refractive index and wavelength. This simulates how light would bend or delay when passing through the cloak.
3. Wavefront Manipulation
â€¢ 	: Multiplies the objectâ€™s wave amplitude by a complex exponential phase mask, simulating the cloaking effect.
â€¢ 	: Attempts to reverse the phase shift to recover the original object.
4. Iterative Reconstruction
â€¢ 	: Applies constraints (positivity, spatial support) iteratively to refine the reconstruction. This mimics phase retrieval algorithms used in holography and diffraction imaging.
5. Visualization and Interaction
â€¢ 	Uses Matplotlib to display six panels:
â€¢ 	Original object
â€¢ 	Cloaking phase shift
â€¢ 	Apparent image after cloaking
â€¢ 	Basic reconstruction
â€¢ 	Advanced reconstruction
â€¢ 	Reconstruction error
â€¢ 	Interactive buttons allow users to improve or reset the reconstruction, making the simulation dynamic and exploratory.
